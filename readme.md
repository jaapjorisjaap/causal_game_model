# Causal Model for games

This repository shows that it is in principle possible to recover causal models from games. 


### Whats in it?

There are four main parts of this repository

 1) A class that represents models
 2) utility functions that help to automatically generate models and generate data from models.
 3) A genetic algorithm that recovers models based on generated data.
 4) Functions to test how well we can recover the generated models.
 
 To see how the code works, it is best to take a look at the scripts folder. There are example code with explanations.
